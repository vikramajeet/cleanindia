               Cadmium is a chemical element with symbol Cd and atomic number 48.
               This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. 
               Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, 
               it has a lower melting point than other transition metals.
               Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, 
               in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. 
               The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). 
               It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.<br><br>

                             Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic.

              In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in batteries, predominantly in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2 V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide).<br>
                          Cadmium electroplating, consuming 6% of the global production, is used in the aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components.[34] This coating is passivated by chromate salts.<br>
                          Cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, acting as a very effective "neutron poison" to control neutron flux in nuclear fission.<br>Cadmium oxide was used in black and white television phosphors and in the blue and green phosphors of color television cathode ray tubes.[39] Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is used as a photoconductive surface coating for photocopier drums.

                 Cadmium (Cd) is an extremely toxic industrial and environmental pollutant classified as a human carcinogen [Group 1 – according to International Agency for Research on Cancer;[11] Group 2a – according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and 1B carcinogen classified by European Chemical Agency [12][13]

                          Acute exposure to cadmium fumes may cause flu-like symptoms including chills, fever, and muscle ache sometimes referred to as "the cadmium blues." Symptoms may resolve after a week if there is no respiratory damage. More severe exposures can cause tracheo-bronchitis, pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema. Symptoms of inflammation may start hours after the exposure and include cough, dryness and irritation of the nose and throat, headache, dizziness, weakness, fever, chills, and chest pain.<br>

                          Inhaling cadmium-laden dust quickly leads to respiratory tract and kidney problems which can be fatal (often from renal failure). Ingestion of any significant amount of cadmium causes immediate poisoning and damage to the liver and the kidneys.
